\usage{
Fit(data, response)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing both the predictor variables and the response variable.}

\item{response}{A string specifying the column name of the response variable in the data frame.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{coefficients}: A named vector of estimated coefficients, including the intercept.
\item \code{residuals}: A numeric vector of residuals (differences between observed and fitted values).
\item \code{fitted_values}: A numeric vector of fitted values.
\item \code{sse}: Sum of squared errors (residual sum of squares).
\item \code{sst}: Total sum of squares (total variability in the response variable).
\item \code{r_squared}: R-squared, a measure of how well the model explains the variability of the response variable.
\item \code{adj_r_squared}: Adjusted R-squared, accounts for the number of predictors in the model.
\item \code{X}: The design matrix used in the regression analysis.
\item \code{df_total}: Total degrees of freedom (sample size minus one).
\item \code{df_residuals}: Degrees of freedom for residuals (sample size minus number of predictors).

\description{
This function performs linear regression using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method.
It calculates the coefficients for the predictor variables and the specified response variable.
The function also computes various model metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared,
residuals, and fitted values.

# Example data
data <- data.frame(
  Age = runif(100, 20, 80),
  Sex = sample(0:1, 100, replace = TRUE),
  Depression = rnorm(100, 50, 10)
)

# Perform linear regression
result <- Fit(data, "Depression")

# Print the coefficients
print(result$coefficients)
